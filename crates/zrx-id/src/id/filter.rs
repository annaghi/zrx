/// Filter.
///
/// Filters efficiently match identifiers against a set of expressions, which
/// are composed of conditions and logical operators, and compiled into a set
/// of optimized instructions. This makes it possible to evaluate arbitrarily
/// complex logical expressions against identifiers extremely fast.
///
/// Each [`Filter`] manages a [`Matcher`], used to identify matching terms in
/// expressions in nanoseconds, and a set of conditions built from expressions,
/// which are checked for satisfiability by using a bitwise stack-based virtual
/// machine with an optimized set of instructions. Thus, the [`Matcher`] can be
/// thought of as the first stage, eliminating non-matching expressions, while
/// the condition set is the second stage, which checks whether the remaining
/// expressions are actually satisfied by the identifier.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use std::error::Error;
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
/// use zrx_id::{selector, Expression, Filter, Id};
///
/// // Create filter builder and insert expression
/// let mut builder = Filter::builder();
/// builder.insert(Expression::any(|expr| {
///     expr.with(selector!(location = "**/*.md")?)?
///         .with(selector!(provider = "file")?)
/// })?);
///
/// // Create filter from builder
/// let filter = builder.build()?;
///
/// // Create identifier and match expressions
/// let id: Id = "zri:file:::docs:index.md:".parse()?;
/// for index in filter.matches(&id)? {
///     println!("{index:?}");
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
